Even trying to determine that the wave in the above example of the C-major chord is a sum of three different waves of distinct frequencies seems hopeless based just on the plot.\n",

The matter is complicated slightly by the fact that we are dealing with a *sequence of samples* of a function rather than the actual continuous function itself. This means that we have to use an approximation called the **discrete Fourier transform** (DFT), which is usually implemented via a very efficient algorithm known as the **Fast Fourier Transform** (FFT). We won't go into the theoretical details in these lectures, but we can still understand what happens in practice.\n",

In other words $X_{k}$ tells us how much (i.e. the *magnitude*) of the $k/N$ frequency is approximately present in the input signal.

This is already highly useful and many problems can be solved just by computing the DFT and looking at the distribution of the resulting frequencies in order to e.g. classify different audio clips.\n",
    "However, this is a coarse summary statistic of the input audio and as the length of the clip increases its usefulness goes down (or rather the information content does -- think about computing averages of features over a large data set). In order to overcome this problem we apply a very simple trick: **windowing**.\n",

    "Above we plot the spectrogram for the same signal of the C major as before, except this time we add some random noise to it to make the example a bit more interesting. We've also extended the signal to 10 seconds. The window overlap parameter is presented as a fraction of the window length. According to our earlier discussion, the intensity of the colour of each pixel in the spectrogram signifies how much of that particular frequency is present in the signal at given time (or more precisely in the corresponding window of the original sampled signal). Hence, we should expect to see three straight lines at the C major frequencies (roughly: 262 Hz, 330 Hz, 392 Hz) on top of the darker noisy background.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we learnt how sound from the real-world is translated into digital format via a **sampling process**. This necessarily results in a loss of information, but we can minimise its effect by understanding the concepts of **Nyquist frequency** and **Nyquist rate**. We understand that sound is a very complex signal and thus it requires extremely fine-grained data (sampled at a rate of tens of thousands of samples per second). The resulting sequence is tricky to analyse directly and hence we employ a **discrete Fourier transform** in order to separate the different frequency components of the sequence. For longer audio files it is useful to split it into (possibly overlapping) segments where the values inside each segment are weighted according to a **window function**. We can then perform the DFT on each of these segments separately to obtain a **spectrogram**, which shows how the strength of each frequency changes over time. The spectrogram is the most fundamental building block of audio analysis and is usually the first thing to investigate when performing exploratory analysis of sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where to go from here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most audio analysis happens based on the spectrogram (i.e. in the **spectral domain**). There are many useful features you might want to compute based on it. For example, computing the overall **energy** of the signal is easy (think about why it's difficult to estimate it based on the raw signal, i.e. in the **time domain**), or you might be interested around which frequency most of that energy concentrates. These are all called **spectral features** and you can more examples in the [librosa documentation](https://librosa.org/doc/main/feature.html#spectral-features).\n",
    "\n",
    "We leave experimentation with such features to the reader and instead dive deeper into the theory of an important characteristic of sound (or waves or oscillating objects in general) which is **harmonic frequencies** and **resonance**. This is a crucial component for successfully analysing e.g. human speech (in particular for distinguishing vowels) or detecting faults in machinery (how to detect a failing gearbox).\n",
