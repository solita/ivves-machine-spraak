    "# Self-similarity, Kernels and Structural Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll introduce another method to extract structure from audio data (or any ordered sequence for that matter), but this time in the temporal direction (recall that for the cepstrum we were interested in the frequency-axis). We do this by comparing the signal at each timestep to the past (and future) values in order to obtain a measure of its **self-similarity**. This is not much different from computing the autocorrelation of some sequence, except that we are afforded more freedom in deciding what *similarity* actually means in the given context. The power of this method, however, comes from the way we choose to *represent* this information. We organise the similarity values into a matrix (the **self-similarity matrix** (**SSM**)), which allows us to compare different segments across time over the whole input clip. This not only permits the use of analytical methods to detect structure in the signal, but also lets us easily *visualise* this information. The importance of effective visualisation tools should not be underestimated for explorative analysis. The final advantage of the self-similarity method is that it is extremely versatile: it is not in any way reliant on spectral decomposition (even though that's where we'll apply it in this notebook), but works for many different types of signals and feature representations. It can also be used to creatively solve many types of problems of which we'll give a few simple examples in today's lecture."

    "It's quite easy to notice some beat structure in thhe spectrogram, which shows up as brighter vertical lines (when the signal's energy increases across the spectrum). We'll return to this later, but let's compute the self-similarity matrix first. To do this we need to decide on a *similarity metric*. We choose to use the standard Euclidean distance, while other common choices include the scalar product (or the normalised cosine distance), Minkowski distance or Manhattan distance. For more examples see [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.pdist.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Denote the similarity metric by $d$ and our feature sequence (i.e. the sequence of vectors in the frequency-domain that we obtain from the FFT) by $\\langle X_{n}\\rangle$. The self-similarity matrix $S$ is then given by\n",
    "$$S=(s_{ij})=d(X_{i}, X_{j}).$$\n",
    "We will always follow the convention that $d(u, u)=0$ so that equal vectors have similarity score 0 and that $d(u, v)\\geq 0$. The similarity score can either be bounded above (as it is, for example, for the cosine distance) or unbounded (like for the Euclidean distance). Be aware though that this is not a universal convention and it varies in the literature. Nevertheless, we can visualise $S$ as a heatmap so that the $s_{00}$ entry of $S$ also correspond to the upper left-hand corner of the visualisation (again, you will find other conventions in the literature). This computation is very easy to do with the help of SciPy's `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist()` and `scipy.spatial.distance.squareform()`. You should refer to the documentation ([here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.pdist.html) and [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.squareform.html)) to make sure you understand what is happening."
